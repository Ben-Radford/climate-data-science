# climate-statistics
Some useful applications of Climate Statistics using Python. 

This repository should cover most of the celebrated methods of Climatology and is destined both for 
students and professionals. Each notebook is associated with a script properly said (as eigenvalues 
and eigenvectors are), which can be used as a 'hands-on' introduction or anything you might want.

Feel free to make any modifications you find necessary but please, leave the original parts of 
the script headings there (you might add anything you want as well).

This is also an ongoing and completely independent project, which means I'm not getting paid for this. 
However, you can pay me a beer anytime.

If you want to help with suggestions, critics or something else you can send me an e-mail
(or if you're good at stalking people, you can easily find me on Research Gate and Facebook). 

And if the content of this repository helps you to get some results for your future publications, please
don't forget to tell me. I'd love to know it!
