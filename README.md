# Climate Data Science

**Welcome!** This repository is a collection of tutorials, with Jupyter Notebooks and Python code, aimed at data analysis and visualization techniques for Climate Science and Earth Observation studies. All the content is produced by me, [Willy Hagi](https://linktr.ee/willyhagi), and the tutorials are planned to be constantly submitted to publication in [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/), known as one of the biggest data science portals of the web. The entire content is free and will forever be, but if you could find anything useful to you, please consider tossing a [ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/willyhagi) to your meteorologist.  

For the time, it is possible to run with Google Colab only those Jupyter Notebooks with **Google Earth Engine** code. I hope that some serious Cartopy issues with Colab will be solved soon to allow interaction with the others as well.
