# climate-statistics

Some useful applications of Climate Statistics using Python. 

This repository should cover most of the celebrated methods of Climatology and is destined both for 
students and professionals. Each notebook is associated with a proper python script, which can be used as a 'hands-on' introduction or anything you might want - including especially using for research purposes.

don't forget to tell me. I'd like to know it!
